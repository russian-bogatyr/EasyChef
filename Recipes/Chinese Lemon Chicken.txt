3. Then, in a shallow bowl, add the corn starch and season it generously with salt.
4. Dip each strip of the marinated chicken in the corn starch to coat it on all sides and lay them on a baking sheet lined with wax paper, ready to fry.
5. While you're coating the chicken, get a pan on the stove an dheat up about 1/2 inch of oil on medium-high.
6. When the oil is hot, fry the coated chicken strips in small batched for about 4-6 minutes, until it turns a light golden and the chicken is cooked through inside.
7. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Break a big piece to check if the inside is cooked.
8. For the sauce, zest the other lemon into a sauce pan. Add to it, half a cup of lemon juice, 1/2 a cup of chicken stock and a 1/3 of a cup of sugar.
9. Put the pan on medium-high heat and bring the sauce to a boil while stirring to dissolve the sugar.
10. When the sauce starts bubbling, add the corn starch slurry (1/2 tablespoon corn starch and 1 tablespoon water) while stirring constantly.
11. The sauce will thicken fast and turn glossy. Turn off the heat and season it with salt.
12. Add the chicken to a frying pan and slowly spoon in some of the sauce.
