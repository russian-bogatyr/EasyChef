Time
30 minutes

Ingredients
1 1/2 cups long grain white rice
6 packed cups chopped kale
3 boneless chicken thighs chopped into small pieces
Soy sauce
1 shallot of 1/2 small onion, minced
6 garlic cloves, press or minced
Toasted sesame seeds

For the sauce:
1/4 cup mirin
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Instructions
1.Stir together sauce ingredients in a small bowl then set aside.
2. Add rice plus 2 3/4 cup water to a small saucepan then turn heat to high to bring to a boil. Place a lid on top, turn heat down to medium-low, then simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat then let sit covered 3 minutes. Remove lid, fluff rice, then scoop onto a plate to cool and set aside.
3. Fill a large wok 3/4 of the way full with water then bring to a boil. Add kale then simmer until tender but not mush, 4-5 minutes. Drain then squeeze kale very dry with hands once cool enough to handle. Crumble kale into a bowl then set aside.
4. Place wok back over high heat then, making fure there are no droplets of water inside, add oil. Once oil is very hot, add chicken thighs then spread into an even layer and let sear until golden brown on one side, 2 minutes. Add a drizzle of soy sauce, a dash of white pepper, and shallots then continue to saute until chicken is cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Add garlic then saute, stirring constantly, until garlic is very fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minutes.
5. Add crumbled kale then toss to combine. Add cooked rice then toss to combine. Drizzle in sauce then turn heat off and toss to combine. Scoop into plates then top with toasted sesame seeds and serve.
