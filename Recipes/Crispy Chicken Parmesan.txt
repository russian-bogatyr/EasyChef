Crispy Chicken Parmesan

Time 
35 minutes

Ingredients
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 cup flour
2 eggs
1 cup seasoned breadcrumb
2 cups marinara sauce
8 slices fresh mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Fresh basil, thinly sliced
Vegetable oil

Instructions
1. Cut the chicken breasts in half widthwise to make 4 thin breasts.
2. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
3. Coat the chicken in flour, then egg, and the bread crumbs.
4. Pour oil in a cast-iron skillet to come 1/4 inch up the side. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and fry on both sides until brown, about 4 minutes.
5. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
6. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit.
7. Place the fried chicken breasts in a baking dish. If they don't fit side by side, gently overlap them. Pour the marinara sauce over the chicken. Top the mozzarella slices and parmesan.
8. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and bubbling.
